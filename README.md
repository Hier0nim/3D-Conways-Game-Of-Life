# 3D-Conways-Game-Of-Life
Contains my first project made in Unity: 
3D_Conways_Game_Of_Life.

# Controls #
* Set the simulation values in Setting Menu, before the start, or use base values.
* LMB on the cube to make it alive/dead when simulation not running.
* Enter/Spacebar to start/pause simulation
* R to reset Camera back to original position
* Escape to exit to Main Menu

### Only in 3D ###
* WASD to move camera 
* LMB hold and move mouse to rotate camera

### in 2D ###
* LMB hold and drag to pan
* Scroll to zoom in/out

# Important #
As this is my first C# and Unity project, it uses some solutions made by renderguy7768 especially the camera movement and resoures loading.
